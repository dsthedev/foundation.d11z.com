# Todo

## Additions

- Implement a secure SFTP sync workflow to `foundation.d11z.com` via the `dist/` folder
- Add `.htaccess` file to dev workflow (`config.yml:PATHS.assets?`), so it's included after `dist/` is deleted during build process.

## Build R&D

- How exactly is `uncss` being used?

## Content

- Cleanup and better examples in styleguide

## Improvements

- Investigate & fix npm package issues:

```bash
found 43 vulnerabilities (19 low, 15 moderate, 9 high)
  run `npm audit fix` to fix them, or `npm audit` for details
```

## More Ideas

- Implement full file formatter for scss, js, md, yml, etc?
